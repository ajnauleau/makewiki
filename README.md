# üìì Personal Wiki

## Step 1: Follow Setup Guide

 **‚≠êÔ∏è IMPORTANT**: Change **YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME** before hitting `<ENTER>` on the last step.<br>**‚úÖ EXAMPLE**: Change `git remote add https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/makewiki-v1` to `git remote add https://github.com/droxey/makewiki-v1` for [Dani](https://github.com/droxey/makewiki)'s version of the `makewiki` project.

1. **In your browser**, create a **[new public repository](https://github.com/new)** on GitHub called `makewiki-v1`.
2. **In your terminal**, navigate to the directory where you store your projects.
3. **Paste each line below** into the terminal, *one by one*. **Hit `<Return>` after *each* line**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/make-school-labs/makewiki-v1
    cd makewiki
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/makewiki-v1
    ```

4. **Open the `makewiki` repository folder** in your IDE.

## Step 2: Link Repository in Tracker

Add the link to your project in the [Course Tracker](https://make.sc/trackbew1.2).

## Step 3: CRUD Page Instances (Admin Interface)

1. In your terminal, run `python manage.py runserver`.
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser.
3. Enter `admin` for the username and `djangopony` for the password.
4. Click `Pages` on the left, underneath `Users` and `Groups`.
5. Add real world data from 5 random Wikipedia articles using http://wikiroulette.co/.

## Step 4: Solve the Challenges

**NOTE**: Complete the challenges in all files before moving on to stretch challenges. Your grade is dependent on the completion of the challenges only.

1. **REQUIRED**: Complete challenges in each of these files, in order:
    1. `makewiki/urls.py`
    1. `wiki/views.py`
    1. `wiki/urls.py`
    1. `templates/base.html`
2. **OPTIONAL**: Move on to the stretch challenges in the code, or enhance the project using the suggestions below.

You will also need to create templates in `wiki/templates/wiki` for use with your view classes.

**TIP**: Find all challenges by searching the project for instances of the word `CHALLENGE`. To **search all files in your project directory**, press `<Command>` + `<Shift>` + `<F>`, type `CHALLENGE`, and hit `<Return>`.

## Step 5: Level Up

### Suggestions

- Create a beautiful user interface for your wiki. [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/) is included with this starter pack! 
- Customize the project and continue to experiment with the codebase.
- Make the models more sophisticated.
- What other features can you dream up? What would look good on your portfolio? Open up a discussion with your instructor to receive personalized feedback.

## Step 6: Add to Portfolio

Add your `makewiki` implementation to your [Make School portfolio](https://www.makeschool.com/portfolio).
