    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path

CHALLENGES:
    1. Uncomment the path() for the wiki app below. Use it to direct any request (except `/admin` URLs)
        to the the `wiki` app's URL configuration. Use the above docstring to guide you if you feel stuck.
    2. Make sure Django doesn't give you any warnings or errors when you execute `python manage.py runserver`.
